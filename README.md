## Problem 1 (ODE): Cross Material Decay
In this problem, a material is expected to decay into two other (or even more) forms of isotopes. We know that radioactive decay follows the simple ODE:
$\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda * N$

## Problem 2 (numerical): Moment of Inertia for a non-trivial symmetrical object
