# Project 1 Overview

## Problem 1 (ODE): Radioactive Cross-Decay
In this problem, a material is expected to decay into two other (or even more) forms of isotopes. We know that radioactive decay follows the simple ODE:

## $\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N$

Solving the ODE, one yields:
## $N(t) = N(0)e^{-\lambda t}$

In the case of cross-decay into two new substances. One will have total N = N1 + N2, where N1 = N2 = 0 at start. At the same time, 

## Problem 2 (numerical): Moment of Inertia for a non-trivial symmetrical object
