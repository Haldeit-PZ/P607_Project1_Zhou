# Project 1 Overview

## Problem 1 (ODE): Radioactive Cross-Decay
We know that radioactive decay of  substance A-B follows the simple ODE:

## $\frac{dN_A}{dt} = -\lambda N_A(t)$

Solving the ODE, one yields:
## $N(t) = N(0)e^{-\lambda t}$

In this problem, one shall consider an element decaying into other elements in series in the form of A-B-C. In the above single case, the $N$ describes $N_A$ to be specifically

In the case of cross-decay into two new substances. One will have total N = N1 + N2, where N1 = N2 = 0 at start. At the same time,
